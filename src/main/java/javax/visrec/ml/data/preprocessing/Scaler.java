 * Interface to perform scaling of a data set.
 * Scaling generally means to change the range of the values, while the shape of the distribution doesnâ€™t change. 
 * Scaling data set features to range [0, 1] or similar is a common practice
 * in order to prepare data for machine learning training and reduce influence of different value ranges among data.
